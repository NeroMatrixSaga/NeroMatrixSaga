      `The day meant to stand as humanity’s greatest triumph became the blade that shattered reality itself.
      
      A single failed experiment tore through the perfectly balanced matrix of life. The laws that governed existence fractured, and through the rupture emerged something aberrant—an inversion of creation. From a realm later named Cataclysm, beings formed of dark cosmic energies crossed into the human world, driven by a singular, insatiable hunger: souls.
      
      Modern weapons were useless against them. Steel shattered. Fire faded. Bullets passed through their forms as if striking empty space. Only pure energy could wound them—and humanity possessed neither the knowledge nor the means to wield it.
      
      They spread like a plague.
      
      Within hours, cities were erased from maps. Nations collapsed overnight. The massacre was so complete that survival itself ceased to be a hope and became a prayer—for one more minute, one more breath. As extinction loomed and the living stood at the brink of oblivion—
      
      They arrived.
      
      Their origin was unknown. Their power defied every measurable law of reality. They moved like lightning—unseen, unfathomable. No eye could follow them. No instrument could record them. The creatures fell before their advance, erased as though they had never existed. And just as suddenly as they appeared, they vanished, leaving behind no trace of their presence.
      `,

      `When silence finally reclaimed the world, humanity had been reduced to remnants.
      
      Democracy collapsed beneath the weight of survival. Equality became a forgotten myth. Those with power rose to rule, while the remnants of humanity retreated behind colossal walls—barriers separating the living from the dead. And within those walls, as the survivors clung to existence, the true horrors of the matrix slowly began to reveal themselves.

      `Deep beneath the collapsed remains of the old world, something stirred.
      
      In the ruins of Geneva—where stone had fused with ash and time itself lay fractured—an anomaly began to regenerate after centuries of stillness. There was no light, no witness. Only decay layered upon decay, until decay itself was forced to retreat.
      
      Bones assembled first.
      
      Fragments drew together with deliberate intent, fractures sealing as though they had never existed. Muscle followed, threading itself across ivory. Tendons bound structure to motion. Organs formed last, each taking its place with unsettling precision, guided by a memory that did not belong to them.
      Skin crept over it all.
      
      Years passed in silence.
      
      Then—
      A heartbeat.
      Once.
      Twice.
      
      The sound echoed through the hollow ruin like a fault in reality itself.
      
      His eyes opened.
      
      They did not widen in fear or search for meaning. They simply opened, as though the act had been practiced long before the world had forgotten him.
      
      He inhaled.
      The air scorched his lungs.
      `,
      
      `With visible effort, he forced himself upright. His body responded slowly, untrustworthy, as though borrowed rather than owned. He raised his hands before his face—turning them, flexing his fingers—watching skin stretch over muscle that did not yet feel real.
      
      There was no recognition.
      
      No name surfaced.
      
      No memory followed.
      
      No purpose waited behind his eyes.
      
      Only absence.
      
      Strength arrived in fragments—brief, unstable surges that vanished as quickly as they appeared. When he tried to stand, his legs betrayed him. He collapsed, breath ragged, pulse erratic. The body existed, but it had not yet accepted him.
      Time passed again. Minutes, hours—he could not tell.
      
      Eventually, he rose.
      
      Naked and trembling, he staggered from the ruins, each step uneven, each movement learned anew. Outside, the world greeted him with rot and silence. A corpse lay half-buried nearby, long surrendered to decay. He did not recoil. He did not hesitate. He stripped the remains of their clothing and dressed himself with instinctive efficiency.
      
      Instinct guided his hands.
      
      Instinct guided everything.
      
      From a broken ridge above, he noticed movement—armored figures retreating toward something unseen. Soldiers, perhaps. Their backs bore a crest he did not recognize, yet something inside his chest tightened at the sight of it.
      
      His body reacted before thought could intervene.
      
      He followed.
      `,
      `The land around him was a graveyard of civilizations crushed together by ancient force. And rising from that devastation—cutting against the horizon like a scar sealed too tightly—stood a walled kingdom.
      
      Nexmortis.
      
      The fortress loomed impossibly intact, its walls etched with sigils, its towers humming faintly with restrained power. It was not built to protect life.
      
      It was built to contain it.
      
      By nightfall, he reached the intake gate.
      
      The guards inside the checkpoint cabin looked up as he approached, hands hovering near their weapons. Their gazes lingered too long, unsettled by something they could not name.
      
      “Identity?” one asked.
      
      The word meant nothing.
      
      He opened his mouth. Nothing waited there.
      
      “I don’t know,” he said.
      
      Confusion rippled between them. Quiet exchange. Unease.
      
      “Run a scan,” another muttered. “Let MOTHER decide.”
      
      The device activated. Pale light traced his form, pausing where it should not have, lingering as though uncertain. The air grew heavy.
      
      The screen flickered.
      
      Then stabilized.
      
      STATUS		: ELIGIBLE
      NAME			: NEXIS VALDI
      ORIGIN		: UNKNOWN
      INFORMATION	: RESTRICTED
      
      No one touched the controls.
      The gate responded anyway.
      `,
      `Nexis Valdi stepped forward. The name felt distant—like something once spoken to him, then carefully erased.
      Behind him, the gates sealed shut.
      
      One of the guards exhaled slowly.
      “Trial survivor,” he whispered.
      
      None of them sounded convinced.
      
      Ahead, the kingdom waited.
      And somewhere beneath its walls, something older than Nexmortis recognized a return long thought impossible.
