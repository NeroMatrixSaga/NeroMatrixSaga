    <h1>MATRIX INFORMATION</h1>

    <p class="classified">
      The following data fragments were recovered after the collapse.
      Some records remain incomplete. Some truths are restricted.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2>WHAT IS THE MORTAL MATRIX?</h2>
    <p>
      The Mortal Matrix is not a machine, nor a singular entity.
      It is a system that emerged when reality fractured during
      the Tragedy of Geneva.
    </p>
    <p>
      It governs how energy, power, and survival function
      within the altered world.
      Those who interact with it are altered in return.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2>WHY MODERN WEAPONS FAILED</h2>
    <p>
      Entities that crossed into our reality do not fully exist
      within conventional physical laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ballistic weapons, explosives, and traditional technology
      proved ineffective.
      Only direct energy interactions showed measurable impact.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <h2>ENERGY-BASED INTERACTION</h2>
    <p>
      The Matrix enables the conversion of external energy
      into a form the human body can withstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process is unstable.
      Improper synchronization often leads to cellular collapse,
      neural damage, or complete system rejection.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <h2>WHY HUMANITY SURVIVED</h2>
    <p>
      Survival was not achieved through strength,
      but through adaptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those capable of synchronizing with the Matrix
      gained the ability to interact with entities
      from beyond the fractured dimensions.
    </p>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <h2>INCOMPLETE RECORDS</h2>
    <p>
      Large portions of Matrix data remain missing or corrupted.
      Whether this is due to system instability
      or deliberate restriction is unknown.
    </p>

    <p class="classified">
      Further fragments may unlock as the system stabilizes.
