    <h1>MATRIX INFORMATION</h1>

    <p class="classified">This website grants free access to the saga.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2>WHAT IS THE NERO MATRIX SAGA?</h2>
    <p>The <b>NeroMatrix Saga</b> is a <b>dark fantasy saga</b> that blends futuristic science, ancient myth, and cosmic philosophy into a single interconnected universe.</p>
    <p>Set in a reality where life itself is governed by artificial laws, the saga explores themes of existence, balance, memory, free will, and annihilation. Gods are not eternal, heroes are not chosen, and survival often comes at the cost of truth.</p>
    <p>The story unfolds across multiple book series, each focusing on different timelines, characters, and perspectives—gradually revealing the hidden structure of reality known as the <i>Mortal Matrix</i>.</p>
    <p>The Nero Matrix Saga officially began on <b>01.01.2026</b> and is written by <b>Himanshu Sharma</b>.</p>
    <p>At its core, the saga asks one question:</p>
    <p><i>If reality itself is flawed, does it deserve to continue—or to be erased and rebuilt?</i></p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2>WHAT IS THE MORTAL MATRIX?</h2>
    <p>The <b>Mortal Matrix</b> is the <b>first book series</b> of the Nero Matrix Saga.</p>
    <p>It serves as the foundation of the entire saga and introduces the core reality, rules, and conflicts that shape all future events.</p>
    <p>You can access The Mortal Matrix directly through the homepage.</p>
    <p>Set within a broken, artificial reality, the Mortal Matrix follows a world where life is governed by systems, memories can be altered, and survival often comes at the cost of truth. Gods are limited, destinies are engineered, and death is not always the end.</p>
    <p>Currently, the ongoing book is <i>The Lie of Ascension</i>, which is the first book of the Mortal Matrix series.</p>
    <p>The Mortal Matrix is not just the beginning of the story—it is the key to understanding the universe itself.</p>
    <p><i>Before heroes rise and worlds fall, the Matrix must be understood.</i></p>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <h2>INCOMPLETE RECORDS</h2>
    <p>
      Large portions of Matrix data remain missing or corrupted.
      Whether this is due to system instability
      or deliberate restriction is unknown.
